88/06/13:
	Read tape in.  Enabled specific-site binary option for FLIST.
	Most items work as-is, but FLIST and BROWSE executables sometimes crash.
	For example, the "find" command in FLIST.

88/06/15:
	Recompiled objects (userc.olb, fl.obj, more.obj) and relinked.
	To do this, copied some include-files from home into [.c] and [.d],
	since the VMS C-compiler's search rules have changed since I used it
	last (should fix REDO.COM).  Will test against the new executables.

88/06/16:
	Tried CC's /INCLUDE option so I could move the ".h" files into a
	common directory; this did not work: it told me that I exceeded my
	enqueue-quota.

	Relinked sortx; note that link/nodebug does not appear to do anything.

88/06/29:
	Stripped parity bit in output-lines so that boldface/highlighting
	work properly on vt200-class terminals.

88/07/01:
	Added command-table entry for LSEDIT (a la EDIT).  Note that FLIST
	will accept LSEDIT/EDIT/VIEW now to view a list (should plug it).

88/07/11:
	Permit '-' in filenames.

88/08/15:
	observed bugs when helping sam gregory straighten out file protections
	for [.oldcamp] (they weren't readable):
		(a) had a very long display line, which would have been longer
		    than 132 characters before truncation.  this caused a
		    segment violation.
		(b) at one point I lost the oldest part of the command history.

88/08/16:
	corrected 'dirent_conv()', guarding better against buffer overflow on
	very long lines (i.e., > CRT_COLS).

	relinked both flist, browse; increased size by about 16 blocks (may be
	because of VMS 4.7 upgrade).@

88/08/17:
	modified 'termsize.c' and 'getraw.c' so they use SYS$COMMAND rather
	than SYS$INPUT so that VTSIZE works in a LOGIN.COM (works either way
	with FLIST and BROWSE).

88/08/22:
	added test in BROWSE to ensure that we have a filename!

88/09/16:
	corrected "purge" command, which crashed if too many versions were
	protected, since the message-buffer overflow check was wrong.

88/10/03:
	should update using DEC's current acpdef.h files

88/10/05:
	the uid+gid display for pyster+dickey is wrong...should convert to names

88/10/11:
	corrected place in 'dirarg.c' where "/o" alone caused crash.
	added ".DIA" to temp-file types in 'fldlet.c'

88/10/14:
	sometimes FLIST's command history gets garbaged.

	sometimes after an UPDATE command in FLIST, PURGE thinks it has found
	a file which was protected, even though it is successfully removed.

	FLIST does not recognize rooted device names, e.g., a delete applied
	to BOOCH_:[ADT]X.LIS becomes BOOCH_:[000000.ADT]X.LIS, which it does
	not like.

88/11/03:
	the output from my tar program is not readable by BROWSE, though
	other STMLF files are.

88/11/04:
	added expiration-date stuff to FLIST (a la REVISED).  Also, corrected
	places where member/group codes where masked to a single byte.

88/11/17:
	FLIST on SYS$SYSROOT suddenly changes to SYS$COMMON, and the list is
	not sorted properly.

89/02/02:
	port to vms5.0; minor fix to flsort; also there use 'qsort()' instead
	of the previous selection-sort.

89/02/09:
	mod for vms5.0; may set delete-enable on files to rename them, restore
	original protection after renaming.

89/02/16:
	added ".DIF$*", ".SHO" and ".TJL" to list of file-types which are not
	prompted on deletion (fldlet.c).

89/02/24:
	added procedure 'flist_chdir()' to encapsulate (and log) changes of
	working directory.

	modified 'getraw()' so that command-file input is discarded except for
	lines beginning with '$' (leading blanks optional).  This lets me use
	the /LOG output directly as a command-file.

	modified 'more.c' so that the version which is linked into FLIST will
	log output in a form that can be replayed in FLIST's command-file.

89/03/06:
	increased BROWSE's limit on the size of the fseek-vector which it
	maintains; also increased FLIST's limit on log-file width to 132 from
	80.

89/03/20:
	found intermittent problem with RMS where an illegal status code is
	returned -- manifested in a 0x10000 code returned from SYS$PARSE
	call in DCLARG.

89/12/05:
	vms 5.1 altered "prvdef.h" file so that PRV$V_??? is no longer defined.
	altered sysrights.c and callers isowner.c, cmpprot.c to recompile.

	patched out trace in DCLARG for bug found in 89/03/20 (haven't seen it
	under vms 5.1, also conflicts with rebuild).

	corrected typo in 'dirent.c' (wrong variable-type, which previous
	compilers accepted & dealt with properly).
